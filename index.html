                                During development, some bugs will surely creep into the mix. The testing phase ensures everything works as it's supposed to. Depending on the scope of the project, this can take from several days to several weeks. What's important, is that at the end of the day, everything works like a well-oiled machine.

                            If we're going to spend some time working together, it's only fair that you get to know the guy behind the website. My name is Austin, and I earned my Bachelor of Computer Science (BCS) in 2016 from a small-town Massachusetts college. My passion for computer science stretches all the way back to my middle school days, when I was making Sonic the Hedgehog "fanpages" in Microsoft Frontpage. Fortunately I moved past Frontpage, and during my studies I took a particular interest in making beautiful, accessible applications and websites. I focus on a simplistic, "less-is-more" approach to my designs. I believe that the days of cluttered websites, drenched in often unecessary information are far behind us. Anyone, young or old, should be able to navigate the internet with ease, and I want to help make that possible. I look forward to working with you!
