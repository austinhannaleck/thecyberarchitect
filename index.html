                                    During development, some bugs will surely creep into the mix. The testing phase ensures everything works as it's supposed to. Depending on the scope of the project, this can take from several days to several weeks. What's important, is that at the end of the day, everything works like a well-oiled machine.

                                For The Cyber Architect, web design is far more than a job. It's a deeply creative and constantly evolving process. As the internet grows at a rapid pace, so are it's technologies. Now more than ever, a website needs to adapt to the often unpredictable and dynamics digital world.
                                <br><br>
                                We follow a "less-is-more" approach to all of our designs. However, that's not to be mistaken for a lower quality product. We believe in usability over complexity, we favor fluid, responsive designs over static, crowded webpages. We choose to adopt the most cutting-edge technologies, instead of just settling for something "comfortable".

                                    Having an online presence is crucial to the survival of any business. No longer is your potential customer base stuck within the confines of your county. By presenting your business to the world, you're opening yourself up to more customers, which, as a natural result, will generate more sales.

                                    People can see what you have to offer at any time, on any device, anywhere. Whether it's 3am, a holiday, or the weekend, your customers will have access to your business at al times. Not only is it convenient, but in the age of information, it is the expectation.

                                    You know the old saying - it's all about first impressions. When someone opens your website to see that it looks like it was designed in the 1990's, they're going to question the quality of your product. A good looking website goes a long way into giving your customers faith that they are getting involved with a reliable business.

                            If we're going to spend some time working together, it's only fair that you get to know the guy behind the website. My name is Austin, and I earned my Bachelor of Computer Science (BCS) in 2016 from a small-town Massachusetts college. My passion for computer science stretches all the way back to my middle school days, when I was making Sonic the Hedgehog "fanpages" in Microsoft Frontpage. Fortunately I moved past Frontpage, and during my studies I took a particular interest in making beautiful, accessible applications and websites. I focus on a simplistic, "less-is-more" approach to my designs. I believe that the days of cluttered websites, drenched in often unecessary information are far behind us. Anyone, young or old, should be able to navigate the internet with ease, and I want to help make that possible. I look forward to working with you!
