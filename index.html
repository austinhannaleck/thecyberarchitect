                                    During development, some bugs will surely creep into the mix. The testing phase ensures everything works as it's supposed to. Depending on the scope of the project, this can take from several days to several weeks. What's important, is that at the end of the day, everything works like a well-oiled machine.

                            For The Cyber Architect, web design is far more than a job. It's a deeply creative and constantly evolving process. As the internet grows at a rapid pace, so are it's technologies. Now more than ever, a website needs to adapt to the often unpredictable and dynamic digital world.
                            <br><br>
                            We follow a "less-is-more" approach to all of our designs. However, that's not to be mistaken for a lower quality product. We believe in usability over complexity. We favor fluid, responsive designs over static, crowded webpages. We choose to adopt the most cutting-edge technologies, instead of just settling for something we find "comfortable".
                            <br><br>
                            When you choose The Cyber Architect, you're choosing to embrace the future of web design. Don't let your website get left behind.

                                Having an online presence is crucial to the survival of any business. No longer is your potential customer base stuck within the confines of your county. By presenting your business to the world, you're opening yourself up to more customers, which, as a natural result, will generate more sales.

                                You know the old saying - it's all about first impressions. When someone opens your website to see that it looks like it was designed in the 1990's, they're going to question the quality of your product. A good looking website goes a long way into giving your customers faith that they are getting involved with a reliable business.

                        <p>
                            If we're going to spend some time working together, it's only fair that you get to know the guy behind the business. My name is Austin, and I earned my Bachelor of Computer Science (BCS) in 2016 from a small-town Massachusetts college. My passion for computer science stretches all the way back to my middle school days, when I was making Sonic the Hedgehog "fanpages" in Microsoft Frontpage. Fortunately I moved past Frontpage, and during my studies I took a particular interest in making beautiful, accessible applications and websites. I focus on a simplistic, "less-is-more" approach to my designs. I believe that the days of cluttered websites, drenched in often unecessary information are far behind us. Anyone, young or old, should be able to navigate the internet with ease, and I want to help make that possible.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            When I have some free time, you can usually find me playing guitar, brewing homemade beer, or spending time outdoors. I have always had a creative mind, and building websites has been a great outlet for that. I look forward to working with you!
